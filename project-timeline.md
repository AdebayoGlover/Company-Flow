## Where to Start

1. **Begin with core framework** (Week 1-2):
   - First, build the foundation of your vanilla JS component system in `frontend/src/core/`
   - Focus on component.js, router.js, and store.js as these will be used throughout

2. **Early technical decisions**:
   - Define exactly how components will render and update
   - Establish your state management pattern
   - Create conventions for component communication

3. **Build vertically not horizontally**:
   - Instead of building all UI components first, create one complete feature flow
   - For example, implement authentication from backend to frontend before moving to dashboards

## Critical Path Components

These components should be prioritized as they'll be used throughout the application:

1. `core/component.js` - Your component framework
2. `core/router.js` - SPA routing system 
3. `core/store.js` - State management
4. `services/api.js` - API communication
5. `components/common/*` - Reusable UI components

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Performance tracking** - Implement early to catch inefficiencies
2. **Component lifecycle** - Define clear mount/unmount patterns
3. **Memory management** - Ensure proper cleanup to prevent leaks
4. **Error boundaries** - Implement system to contain component failures
5. **Module loading** - Consider how to efficiently load page code
